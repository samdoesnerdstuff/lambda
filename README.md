# lambda

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-C-blue?logo=c)

An interpreted Lua-like scripting language hobby project. The implementation is mostly in C with some C++ sprinkled throughout as absolutely needed. This language takes a lot of inspiration from Lua in terms of portability *and* implementation style. There is no real *goal* to this project besides seeing if this can even be done when working part-time on it.

Lambda is interpreted, since I can't even imagine how complex writing a compiler would be.
