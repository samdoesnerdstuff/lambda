# lambda

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-C-blue?logo=c)

An interpreted Lua-like scripting language hobby project. The implementation is mostly in C with some C++ sprinkled throughout as absolutely needed. This language takes a lot of inspiration from Lua in terms of portability *and* implementation style. There is no real *goal* to this project besides seeing if this can even be done when working part-time on it.

Lambda is interpreted, since I can't even imagine how complex writing a compiler would be.

If you would like to contribute to the cause, you're more than welcome to! Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you do! Just remember that the only dependencies should come from either the C standard library and to use `#preprocessors` when dealing with OS-specific functions, such as file handling on POSIX over Windows.

## Writing Lambda

> [!TIP]
> This is unfinished, and subject to change!

## Using the Interpreter

> [!CAUTION]
> The interpreter itself is finished and likely contains bugs and pitfalls, use this carefully!
