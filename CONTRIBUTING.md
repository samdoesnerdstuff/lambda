# Contributing to Lambda

Contribution requires a fair bit of knowledge on the C programming langauge. There are also a few style rules that should be followed when contributing code.

This guide is fairly simple, the rules are easy:
 - `snake_case` across the board, types, functions, variables, all `snake_case`
 - Comments should follow the `/* */` format from C89, AKA: ANSI C.
 - The 80col rule is a hard limit, all code and comments should remain under 80col.
 - C99 is the targeted C standard for universal compatibility. Please avoid later C features.
